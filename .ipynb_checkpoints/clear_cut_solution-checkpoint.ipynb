    "This project was from a Kaggle competion closed in 2014. \n",
    "[Link to Data page on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction/data)\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to classify trees from four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. Each observation is a 30m x 30m patch. The \"labels\" are 7 \"cover types\". They are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Spruce/Fir\n",
    "2. Lodgepole Pine\n",
    "3. Ponderosa Pine\n",
    "4. Cottonwood/Willow\n",
    "5. Aspen\n",
    "6. Douglas-fir\n",
    "7. Krummholz\n",
    "\n",
    "The training set (15120 observations) contains both features and the labels. The test set contains only the features. Compared to the training set, the test set is very large with 565892 observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 54 features, include 40 soil types (binary), 4 wilderness ares (binary), and 10 numerical features, such as Elevation, slope, aspects and distances to certain points.\n",
    "\n",
    "We quickly noticed that the training data size is less than 3% of the testign data. We might not have enough diversites in the training data to predict the labels for testign data. We also noticed that 100% accuracy was achieved in this Kaggle competion previously, but that appeared to due to a \"cheat\" already known to the Kaggle team. As such, our objective is not to obsess over the accuracy of the \"testing data\", but to explore which classficiation algorithm and/or process works best for the dataset. In addition, some \"cover types\" appear to be easy to confuse, such as \"spruce/fir\" and \"lodgpole pine\". We confirmed this suspicsion by performing exploratory data analysis first. Our EDA is documented in the \"explanatory_data_analysis\" notebook. To imporve model performance, we need to find a way to bettr differentiate between type 1 and 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the perceived higher confusion rate between type 1 ad type 2 trees from the EDA, and between type 3 and 6 trees, we performed a separate training on these 2 subsets. We also performed other feature engineering steps, which include scaling numerical features, power-transfomration of \"elevation\" and dropping some less frequent soil types or \"distance\" related features. In addition, dFor better organizaiton of the code, we saved all the feature engineering functions under a separate module, called \"feature_engineering.py\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, to make the computing environment portable and enable collaboration among team members, we created a docker container based on the image \"jupyter/tensorflow-notebook\". Details about the container is documented in the \"readme.md\" file. \n",
    "\n",
    "This noteboook documents the model development, evluation and final testing process. In each section, we included a flowchart to summarize the feature engineering applied and modeling processes. We experimented with different algorithms, including KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Adaboost, Gradient Boosting(XGBoost), and neural networks(MLP). Without separate training, the accuracy for \"dev data\" from both MLP and XGBoost was already in 84%-86% range. With separately trained sub-models, the accuracy for \"dev data\" from both MLP and XGBoost models was above 90%. However, when applied to the \"testing data\", the accuracy dropped to 74%. We suspect that it's mainly due to the small training data size,and the model is overfitting. To include more observations in the training data, we used 90/10 split instead of 80/20. And, to counter the impact of overfitting, we used \"max_depth=1\" in training the Random Forest model. While this decreased the Randome Forest model accuracy for the dev data to 40%, it works well in our manual ensemble to serve as a disserting vote. Our final model is based on a manual ensemble where we take the majority vote of the predictions from the top 5 performing algorithms (KNN, Random Forest, Adaboost, XGBoost and MLP) for this use case. Where there is a tie, we took the prediction from the XGboost model. This manual ensemble model is documented in the \"model.py\" file.  In the end, we achieved over 94% accuracy on the dev data and over 76% accuracy on the testing data. \n"
