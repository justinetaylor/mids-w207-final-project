# ### Load Data

# Read in training data 
train_df = pd.read_csv("data/train.csv")
test_df = pd.read_csv("data/test.csv")


# ### Initial Data Exploration
# 
# First, we check the data attributes, quality and shape.

# In[60]:


# Examine shape 
print(train_df.shape)

# Briefly examine feature attributes for the training data

# In[62]:


sns.violinplot(x=train_df['Cover_Type'],y=train_df['Elevation'])

# ### Feature Engineering 1
# Now we'll transform the "Aspect" into cosine and sine values to improve the representation of directions.

# In[71]:


#drop Id column as it is not a meaningful feature.
train_df.drop(columns=["Id"],inplace=True)
test_df.drop(columns=["Id"],inplace=True)


# ## Soil Type
# 
# Right now we have 40 composite types of soil. We are going to re-categorize those into their component parts with a 1 for if a component is present. 0 if they are not present. 
# 
# #### Adjustments to the data 
# 
# Looking throught the data, we see several areas where the data can be cleaned. The USDA which is the cabinet department which oversees the forest service, publishes a guide on Soil Taxonomy. (https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/home/?cid=nrcs142p2_053577). This guide was very helpful in interpreting several areas where the data can be trimmed down. 
# 
# * Filler words
#   * "Family / "families" denotes a larger soil group such as Leighcan or Cryaquolls, but these words themselves don't actually carry any information about the group. 
#   * "complex" is another word that appears in the docuement but doesn't actually convey any information itself
#   * "typic" just means that a soil fits into the most general subgroup of the family listed. In the context of the soil types listed, it is useless because only a few soil types list it, and those that don't list it don't list a more specific subgroup that they are a part of. So, they would also generally be assumed to be typic (see guide to soil taxonomy linked above.)
# * Cryaquolis and aquolis types don't exist
#   * Looking through the guide to soil taxonomy, there is no such type as cryaquolis and aquolis. The simplest interpretation is that these are typos. Cryaquolls and aquolls do exist (see link above). I will change the words accordingly.
#   
# #### Possible future work
# 
# * See if the "very/extremely" qualifiers on stony should be removed. Do they mean the same thing?
# * See if changing "rubbly", "bouldery", "stoney" to all one indicator would be better. Do they all mean the same thing?

## Explanation of xform
    # It turns out that multiplying our original soil matrix by xform using matrix mutiplication
    # will just give us a matrix that has been converted to the new feature space. 

# Grab out the new features (that are replacing s_01 thru s_40)
new_cats = cv.get_feature_names()
